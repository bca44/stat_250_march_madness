# stat_250_march_madness

BYU's stat250, Fall 2024

This was a fun project. I teamed up with Micah Pew, a classmate, to analyze 20+ years of March Madness data. We worked hard to write functions to efficiently scrape the data we needed (in accordance with all Terms of Use of the websites we used), join and match datasets, and perform analysis to gain understanding.

In the end, we didn't gain nearly as much as we expected. I guess it makes sense that March Madness has more to it than two-way tests and even ANOVA can really handle. However, I learned a lot and had a lot of fun with it, so I wouldn't change a thing.
